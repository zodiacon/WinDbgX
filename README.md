# WinDbgX
WinDbg is scary to newcomers, and even from veterans it leaves much to be desired. Its UI is basic, and provides very little for most scenarios.
WinDbgX attempts to create a WinDbg alternative based on the same DbgEng.Dll debugger engine, but use WPF to create better UI,
with support for extension commands as well as built-in commands.
